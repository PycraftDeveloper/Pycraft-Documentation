_init_
__________
This subroutine is in charge of running the startup menu and also creating a thread that checks Pycraft's directory for required resources. This GUI runs before the theme decision menu, so if the user hasn't already set a theme then the startup animation will default to default. (The default theme for Pycraft is 'dark').

* Args:

  * self (dict): This is used by Pycraft as a way of storing it's current configuration and behaviour and is required by most GUIs. Its use should be reduced where possible for readability reasons.

* Keyword Args:

  * None

* Output:

  * None
