__init__
__________
This subroutine adds restarting functionality into Pycraft. To do this we run a command in a separate process 'python main.py' which launches a separate instance of Pycraft before we then close the current instance.

* Args:

  * platform (str): This string tells the subroutine which operating system we are using. This is needed for OS specific operations.

  * base_folder (str): This string is a file path to the resources for Pycraft on your device.

* Keyword Args:

  * None

* Output:

  * None

settings_gui
