About
----------
Pycraft is a 3D open-source, open-world video game made in Python. For a long time attempts to make large 3D games in Python have been ignored, we believe there are two reasons: one; People use Python primarily for data handling and processing and not graphics and, two; there is little to no documentation out there to do anything more than make a 3D rotating cube in Python. Making a 3D game in Python for us hasn't been an easy experience, far from it but we have decided to share my project, complete with tutorials, explanations, articles and code explanations in the hope that 3D game development in Python can be seen as a more easily attainable target, and to fill that gap in documentation. Pycraft then is a trial project, as we learn and experiment on what goes best where and how thing go together, this is why development can sometimes appear to have stopped, because we are learning and testing what we have learned, so hopefully for people in the future it will be an easier experience. Also, don't forget there is more to game development than just graphics, there is AI, sound, physics and all the other GUIs that go with it, and as we learn the quality of the overall program will improve. Pycraft is not going to be the final name of the game, however until something better becomes available, we shall stick to it.


----------
Setup
----------

Installing the project from GitHub (Method 1)
__________
The project will download as a (.zip) compressed file. Please make sure you have the project decompressed before use. Next make sure that any folders and files outside of the 'Pycraft' folder are removed and that the 'Pycraft' file is in the intended place for the file to be run from. This file can be freely moved around, transported between drives, computers and folders in this form!

*Just make sure that if you plan to use the installer that you make sure the file location is correct after you have moved the project, to do this simply remove everything in the 'pycraft/Data*Files/InstallerConfig.json' file and re-load the game, it will try to repair the file and write the new path instead, during this process it may appear that Pycraft has crashed as it will likely bring up an error message, a more user-friendly experience is coming soon**

When running the program please make sure you have a minimum of 1GB of free space on the drive and also have Python 3.7 or above installed on your device. This can be found here: (www.python.org/downloads). The version of Python isn't too important in this circumstance however the project has been tested in Python 3.7 and above and is known to work. In addition to all this please make sure you have the following modules installed on your device:

Pygame, Numpy, Pillow, PyAutoGUI, Psutil, PyWaveFront, CPUinfo, Ctypes, ModernGL, ModernGL*Window, GPUtil, Pyrr, PyJoystick, Noise and Matplotlib.

For those not familiar they can be found here: (pypi.org).

You can use the following syntax to install, update and remove these modules:

``pip install <module>``
``pip uninstall <module>``

Here is a short video tutorial walk you through all this: (https://youtu.be/DG5YbE-umw0)


Installing the project from GitHub (Method 2)
__________
If you are installing the project from the GitHub releases page or through Source Forge, then this will be relevant for you.
After you have selected your preferred file type (it'll be either a compiled (.exe) file or a (.zip) file, those that download the (.zip) file will find the information above more relevant.

If you, however, download the (.exe) type file, then this will be more relevant for you. If you locate the file in your file explorer and double click it, then this will run the project. You do not need Python, or any of the projects required modules, as they come built-in with this method. This method does also not install anything extra to your devise, to remove the project, simply delete the (.exe) file in your file explorer. Please note that it can take a few moments for everything in the (.exe) file to load and initialise, so nothing might not appear to happen at first. Also, you can only run one instance of Pycraft at any time (even if you are using another method).


Installing from PyPi (preferred)
__________
If you are installing the project from PyPi, then you will need an up-to-date build of Python (3.7 or greater ideally) and also permission to install additional files to your device. Then you need to open a command-line interface (or CLI), we recommend Terminal on Apple based devises, and Command Prompt on Windows based machines. You install the latest version of Pycraft, and all its needed files though this command:

``pip install Python-Pycraft``

and you can also uninstall the project using the command:

``pip uninstall Python-Pycraft``

And now you can run the project as normal.
Please note that at present it can be a bit tricky to locate the files that have downloaded, you can import the project into another python file using:

``import Pycraft``


Installing using Pipenv
__________
You can alternatively run these commands in the directory containing a file called `Pipfile`:

``pip install pipenv`` then: ``pipenv install python-pycraft``

And to start the game: ``pipenv run python <PATH to 'main.py'>``


----------
Running The Program
----------
When running the program, you will either have a (.exe) file, downloaded from the releases page, or you will have the developer preview, if you have the developer preview, which can be found in the files section of this repository then this is how you run that program.

Now you have the program properly installed hopefully (you'll find out if you haven't promptly!) you need to locate and run the file "main.py" if it crashes on your first run then chances are you haven't installed the program correctly, if it still doesn't work then you can contact us. We do hope however that it works alright for you and you have a pleasant experience. This program has been developed on a Windows 64-bit computer however should run fine on a 32-bit Windows machine (uncompiled) or through MacOS although they remain untested for now. 

We recommend creating a shortcut for the "main.py" file too so it's easier to locate.

Changes
----------
Pycraft v9.5.0 is now live! Here is a list of all the added features to this major update: 



* Feature: This update features the new start-up animation by Dogukan Demir.

* Feature: This update also includes transitional effects between the different GUIs, which can be seen when navigating through different GUIs

* Feature: Basic collisions have been added to Pycraft, with better implementations coming after Pycraft v9.4.0


* Feature: Screen animation/transitions have been added throughout the project. This was showcased in Pycraft v9.4.1 but now works with the Pycraft v9.5.0 update.

* Feature: Wide range support for controllers has been added, you can now use a controller seamlessly throughout the game (currently only PS4 controllers have been tested but that's only due to hardware limitations).

* Performance: The inventory and map sections have had some serious performance optimisations, up to 2x in frame rates there now compared to Pycraft v9.4.0.

* Feature: The adaptive mode AI style performance adjustment utility has been re-written and now performs much better.

* Bug-Fix: The map icon in the map GUI now has transparency and a lightly improved resolution.


* Feature: The game engine has been completely redesigned, now with an additional utility file ("GameEngineUtils.py") that helps to make the project more modular. This was done as part of making the game engine compatible with shadow mapping, the focus of this update. At the same time, we have improved other game engine functions and improved performance, and fixed numerous bugs some of which are listed below:

* Bug-Fix: You can now move in the direction of the camera with either WASD or the controller.

* Bug-Fix: The camera movement is not restricted to the size of the window.

* Bug-Fix: The screenshot functionality for the inventory now supports multiple monitors (* although for now this functionality is windowed mode only)

* Feature: Accessing the inventory and map functions from in game are now significantly faster and does not take you back to the load screen.

* Feature: All of Pycraft's functions now have error handling in some form, with the most common method now closing the program and displaying a suitable error message onscreen.

* Feature: The entire adaptive mode functionality has been reprogrammed and is now much better at changing the performance of the game to balance performance and detail.

* Bug-Fix: The home screen had numerous issues with the bottom of the screen, this has now been fixed and the messages function is cleaned up. Also, on the home screen, the name has changed from "Tom Jebbo" to PycraftDev as that is the username that we use for my Pycraft related accounts - avoiding confusion.

* Identified-Bugs: There is an issue with changing to full-screen in game, when pressing any keys or interacting with the window will make an 'error sound' although no error is raised and the project runs fine.

* Identified-Bugs: There is an issue with moving backwards and left using the controller or keyboard, this will be fixed before the full release of Pycraft v9.5.0.


* Feature: The game engine now has had a sky change, instead of using 6 unique textures in a cube style, we now use one texture and a sphere to reduce the complexity and number of files Pycraft uses.

* Feature: The game engine has now got a skysphere (that is a spherical skybox) that changes with time. We have an 8-minute day, with a 2-minute sunset, then an 8-minute night with a 2-minute sunrise, this means 1 hour is 50 seconds long in real time.

* Feature: The game engine now includes celestial entities, in the form of the sun and moon, which are in sync with the day and night periods and are the light source through the day/night cycles.

* Feature: The game engine now includes a fog effect, this is not noticeable unless you travel really far at the moment, with fog starting at 1200m and ending at 1600m, this is going to be much more noticeable when the final map for the game is released, which will be much larger than it is right now and take advantage of this effect. Additionally, this will be edited in the next update to change based on the weather conditions.

* Feature: The game engine now has dynamic shadows that adjust based on the time of day, with more harsher shadows coming in the night to reflect the change in lighting.

* Bug-Fix: The benchmark function now works completely after issues with the OpenGL section and trying to use deprecated functions.

* Bug-Fix: Many issues with the installer are being fixed in the next few updates, if you identify one, please feel free to let us know so we can fix it!

* Bug-Fix: Many improvements have been made to the game engine to improve the quality of the shadows, which are now much less glitchy.

* Performance: Yet more performance improvements have been made to Pycraft, in particular in the game engine section.


* Feature: The game now includes the start of a weather implementation, including procedurally generated clouds that move around the player. The clouds and weather will change randomly through the day/night, based on the rough relative probabilities of that respective weather in the UK. They also employ the fog effect we added to the terrain last time and have variable height based on the weather. Additionally, the fog throughout the game now varies based on the current weather, so on a rainy day there will be more fog.

* Feature: The entire project has started to undergo restructuring to bring it in line with some of the PEP-8 standards.

* Bug-Fix: Numerous issues and bugs have been fixed regarding the benchmark functionality and exiting the benchmark now is much friendlier and any errors that used to be raised have now been fixed.

* Bug-Fix: More work has been done on the installer to improve its functionality, expect more improvements and eventual Linux compatibility there.

* Identified-Bugs: After toggling between full-screen in the 2D engine of Pycraft (which uses Pygame) the window cannot be resized on some systems, even with the correct flags.

* Identified-Bugs: The installer will render incorrectly if the user has chosen to scale their displays.

* Identified-Bugs: The cloud noise file for Pycraft (Rand*noise.png) is only generated once and the file is never re-written unless it's deleted.

* Bug-Fix: we are improving compatibility with non-Nvidia GPUs as the GLSL programmes can occasionally incur errors due to minor changes to how different GPUs accept syntaxes.


* Feature: The day and night has had some work done, the orbital path of the sun and moon in altered, simplified and along with many other formulae for the GameEngine.py and GameEngineUtils.py modules been simplified and tidied up a bit.

* Feature: Introducing storms, thunder and lightning has been added to the storm section of Pycraft under the 'rain.heavy.thundery' tag.

* Feature: The probabilities of different weather events ( as well as their duration) has been tweaked in Pycraft.

* Feature: Added a rain sound effect that plays when the weather tag is not 'sunny'.

* Feature: Adjusted how audio (sound and music) is handed in Pycraft slightly.

* Performance: We have made many more performance improvements to Pycraft since Pycraft v9.4.4, including the introduction of mip-maps for textures in OpenGL

* Feature: There have been tweaks to the shadow mapping function so now there is a greater variation between day and night and different weather events.

* Feature: All of the commonly used functions in Pycraft's 2D engine have been added to one function in DisplayUtils.py to improve upgradability and to simplify other areas of the project.

* Identified-Bugs: After toggling between full-screen in the 2D engine of Pycraft (which uses Pygame) the window cannot be resized on some systems, even with the correct flags.

* Identified-Bugs: The installer will render incorrectly if the user has chosen to scale their displays.

* Bug-Fix: The cloud noise file for Pycraft (Rand*noise.png) is only generated once and the file is never re-written unless it's deleted.

* Feature: We have started work on converting most of the audio files to the same format (.ogg) and suitably giving accreditation in the credits GUI and later here.


* Bug-Fix: Improved the joystick implementation and fixed issues that occurred when applying pep8 to Pycraft.

* Feature: Introducing rain particles to Pycraft, they are randomly coloured and are the final distinctive feature of the weather implementation in Pycraft!

* Feature: Introducing the concept of multi-texture terrain into Pycraft, for now there is a grass and rock texture with more complex use cases for this coming soon.

* Feature: We now blend (linearly interpolate) between the different weather events in Pycraft, including the colour and height of the clouds and transparency of the skysphere based on different weather events.

* Feature: We have improved the installer for Pycraft and work on adding Linux compatibility is continuing. We have updated the installer to be compatible with Pycraft v9.5.0

Again, feedback would be much appreciated this update was released on; 19/07/2022 (UK date; DD/MM/YYYY). As always, we hope you enjoy this new release and feel free to leave feedback.

Understanding the release notes
----------
This section will hopefully provide additional information on helping to read the release notes. Points detailed after the "Feature" tag are what was focused on in the update and will likely always be present in each update, often this is the most significant area of the update. Points detailed after the "Bug-Fix" tag are likely to be the most frequent, they outline the most major bugs that have been fixed in this update, although they are not the only bugs that have been fixed. Points detailed after the "Performance" tag are used where there have been significant performance improvements to the project. Points detailed after the "Identified-Bugs" tag are bugs that have been identified in the project and that haven't been fixed as of writing the release notes, these are significant issues and will be fixed as soon as possible. Points detailed after the final "Documentation" tag are indicators of significant improvements to the documentation.


----------
Input mapping
----------
This section will be replaced with a dedicated file for keymapping as well as an in-game guide. The controller keys are labelled differently between controllers but have the same mapping in game.

Keyboard
__________


* Use W, A, S, D in game to move around, and use these keys in the map GUI to move that around.

* Use SPACE to jump in game, reset your zoom in the map GUI, start the benchmark section, or press 10 times to enter Devmode.

* Use E in game to access your inventory

* Use R in game to access the map

* Use F11 to toggle full-screen

* Use Q to access a resource value screen

* Use L in game to toggle locking your mouse (forcing it to stay in the window or not)

* Use X to exit Devmode


Mouse
__________


* SCROLL in the map to zoom in/out, or to scroll the settings menu

* LEFT CLICK to select


Controller
__________


* Use the HAT keys (or the 4 buttons typically on the left of the controller in a '+' shape) to navigate between menu options

* Use the JOYSTICKs for camera panning and in game movement

* Use the 'Options' button to enter your inventory

* Use the 'Share' buttons to enter the map

* Use the Y or TRIANGLE button to jump in game or exit a GUI (not in game)

* Use the X or A button to start the benchmark or to reset your view in the map

* Use the X or SQUARE button to zoom in on the map GUI

* Use the O or B button to zoom out on the map

*A detailed map of inputs for keyboard and mouse or controller combinations is coming; for now, see the section below, toggling between full-screen is currently not bound to a button on the controller because we will need all the different buttons for gameplay*


----------
Our Update Policy
----------
New releases will be introduced regularly, it is likely that there will be some form of error or bug, therefore unless you intend to use this project for development and feedback purposes (Thank you all!) we recommend you use the latest stable release; below is how to identify the stable releases.


----------
Version Naming
----------
Pycraft's versions will always now follow the structure; "vA.B.C"

* Where "A" is the major revision number.

* Where "B" is the minor revsision number.

* Where "C" is the patch and developer preview numbers (combined).

Every version of Pycraft as of the 27/10/2022 (DD/MM/YYYY) must feature all 3 values. Updates also now go sequentially, so Pycraft v9.6.4 is newer than Pycraft v9.5.7. If either of the "A" or "B" version numbers is incremented in a release, documentation MUST be suitably updated, in addition Pycraft MUST be released on PyPi, SourceForge and as a release on GitHub.


----------
Releases
----------
All past versions of Pycraft are available under the releases section of Pycraft, this is a new change, but just as before, major releases like Pycraft v0.9 and Pycraft v0.8 will have (.exe) releases, but smaller sub-releases will not, this is in light of a change coming to Pycraft, this should help with the confusion behind releases, and be more accommodating to the installer that's being worked on as a part of Pycraft v9.4.0. This brings me on to another point, all past updates to Pycraft will be located at the releases page (Thats all versions), and the previous section on the home-page with branches will change. The default branch will be the most recent release, then there will be branches for all the sub-releases to Pycraft there too; and the sister program; Pycraft-Insider-Preview will be deprecated and all data moved to relevant places in this repository, this should hopefully cut down on the confusion and make the project more user-friendly.


----------
Other Sources
----------
We now post a roughly monthly article about Pycraft, showing behind the scenes, tips and tricks and additional information, this is shared to both Medium (medium.com/@PycraftDev) and Dev (dev.to/PycraftDev) and builds on the regular posts we share to Twitter (twitter.com/PycraftDev) and Dev (dev.to/PycraftDev).
